<h2>My Career Journey</h2>
<article>
    <h3>Military Background</h3>
    <p>My journey has led me from the U.S. Army to the forefront of technology. In the Army, serving
        as a
        Satellite Communications Technician and Team Leader at Fort Drum, New York from 2008 to
        2012, I
        mastered the intricacies of mobile satellite communications and network coordination. This
        role
        involved handling a mobile satcom terminal and interfacing with a mobile networking hub to
        ensure
        seamless connectivity for tactical operations. My time in the military was more than just
        about
        discipline; it was about honing technical and leadership skills under challenging
        conditions.</p>

    <h3>Academic Achievements</h3>
    <p>Following my military service, I pursued academic interests at Harrisburg University of
        Science &
        Technology, earning a B.S. in Computer & Information Science, graduating Cum Laude. My
        university
        years were an immersive exploration into the world of computer science, forming a solid
        foundation
        for my technology career.</p>

    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    <h4>Elsevier</h4>
    <p>My professional journey in software engineering began at Elsevier in Philadelphia. As a
        Software
        Engineer, I was deeply involved in full-stack web development for an authoring workflow
        system used
        in clinical medicine. Utilizing Java and Spring for backend development, and JavaScript with
        ExtJS
        for the frontend, I contributed to enhancing the efficiency and functionality of the system,
        significantly impacting the way clinical experts author, review, and approve evidence-based
        guidance.</p>

    <h4>Vanguard</h4>
    <p>At The Vanguard Group, my role evolved, leading me to spearhead the development of a
        web-based tool
        for back-office staff. This project involved creating a system for reconciling transaction
        errors
        and providing comprehensive dashboards and reporting tools for retail money movement. Here,
        my
        toolkit expanded to include Java for backend microservices, hosted on ECS, and DynamoDB for
        database
        management. My efforts not only optimized processes but also brought about a significant
        reduction
        in processing time and bolstered security, earning me recognition and awards.</p>

    <h4>Macquarie Group</h4>
    <p>Today, at The Macquarie Group, Iâ€™m harnessing my extensive experience to lead and innovate in
        new
        technological ventures. My career is a testament to continuous learning and excellence, with
        each
        role contributing significantly to my expertise in managing and implementing cutting-edge
        technology
        solutions.</p>
